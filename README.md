For my fourth and last project (MS4) I decided to create a fast food delivery site/application that allows users to make fast food orders by selecting from a set menu of items and inputting their address details for delivery. The site includes the use of an e-commerce payment gate to allow users to pay for their orders before they are dispatched. There is also a staff login area where staff can view the total number of orders for the day and the total revenue generated for that particular day and the ability to sign-off an order as completed for dispatch.
