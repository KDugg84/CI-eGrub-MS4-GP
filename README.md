For my fourth and last project (MS4) I decided to create a fast food delivery site/application that allows users to make fast food orders by selecting from a set menu of items and inputting their address details for delivery. The site includes the use of an e-commerce payment gate to allow users to pay for their orders before they are dispatched. There is also a staff login area where staff can view the total number of orders for the day and the total revenue generated for that particular day and the ability to sign-off an order as completed for dispatch.

## Site Objectives

Design and create a food delivery website to demonstrate an increasing understanding of the libraries and frameworks available to developers.

My main objectives are:

* I wanted to make the site easily accessible and intuitively navigated for the users.

* Allow users to search the menu and then decide what they would like to order.

* Allow users to pay for their orders with the use of a payment gate.

* The use of the backend framework which allows staff to login to the restuarant to check and sign-off on orders.

* I used ElephantSQL to store the SQLite3 database for this project.
